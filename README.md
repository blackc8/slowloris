# slowloris
fastly take down the web
## What is it?
This tool is a DoS attacking tool that uses the slowloris technique to take down a HTTP webserver by RSnake.
The tools firstly creates a number of socket, then send an intial packets to make the server aware of the connection.After so it send small junks of data to the server to keep the connection alive.
This way it increase the server's no of acceptable connections and at a certain point the server could not accept more connection from any client and the server goes down.
